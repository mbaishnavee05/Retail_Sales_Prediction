#Retail Sales Prediction

I dealt with the past data of Europe Drug stores in this project and the dataset name was "Rossmann Store"

Sales forecasting plays an integral role in setting expectations and making plans for your business. Itâ€™s your best shot at predicting the future. Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set.

I performed an exhaustive analysis in order to gain insights and engineer features with an interactive exploratory analysis and finally will use different algorithms to predict.
